Hey! I am Liangtao Zheng. I'm an graduate student (expected to graduate in 2024) from Dept of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.ucsd.edu/), University of California, San Diego. Prior to that, I received my B.Eng. in Cyberspace Security from Wuhan University. Currently, I am a research intern at [MARS Lab](http://group.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~marslab/#/) in [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University, advised by [Prof. Hang Zhao.](https://hangzhaomit.github.io/). I am also also fortunate to collaborate with [Prof. Yue Wang](https://yuewang.xyz/). 

I am especially interested in 3D vision and autonomous driving. I am also experienced in algorithm designing, winning 4 silver medals in the ACM-ICPC Regional.

# Education

For my academic performance in Wuhan University:
- GPA: 3.94/4.00, Rank **1/114**

Selected courses:
- Data Structure (98)
- Advanced Mathematics (96)
-	Probability Theory and Statistics (99)	


# Projects

**Project 1:** Large-scale 3D Visual Localization (MegSLAM) for Mobile Client
*MEGVII (Face++) Beijing Research Institute, China*
- Independently developed a localization algorithm for iOS and Android in C++, used in the Winter Olympic Games.
- Successfully optimized modules, achieving 2x speed up for overall performance and 75% reduction in database size.
- Applied SLAM algorithms like RANSAC, exploited toolchains and portable libraries like ONNX for cross-compiling.

#### Project 2: Waymo 2022 3D-camera-only-detection Challenge
*MARS Lab @ IIIS, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China*\
**Advisor:** *Prof. Hang Zhao*
- Built entire deep learning training workflow and performed supervise learning with state-of-the-art 3D detectors. Fine-tuned the models and obtained an average precision of 63%. Optimized the evaluator to speed up evaluation.
- Provided detailed code annotations and my method to the MMDET3D community on GitHub (3000+ stars).
- Authored a tutorial to analyze the terabyte-scale dataset, filling an official tutorial gap and receiving 60+ likes.

#### Project 3: Cross-dataset Sensor Alignment: Making Visual 3D Object Detector Generalize (under review in CoRL2023)
*MARS Lab @ IIIS, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China*\
**Advisor:** *Prof. Hang Zhao*
- Independently led the project, executing all coding, result analysis, and academic paper composition.
- Trained and tested models under over 700+ different settings to investigate 7 factors that cause camera-based 3D detector fails to generalize on different datasets, which improved the precision by 25%+ on all datasets.
- Learned and processed 8 large autonomous driving datasets into a unified dataset containing 470,000 frames.
- Led regular meetings and sought timely advice from experienced co-authors to ensure smooth project progression.


# Other Experiment
**Student Tutor (part-time)**, Jun. 2019 - Jan. 2021
